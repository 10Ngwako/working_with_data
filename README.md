This compilation of projects is subdivided into three projects. Project 1 is a data analysis project to enhance skills in data analysis and perform statistical analysis on the dataset. Project 2 is data cleaning using pandas to perform cleaning operations like handling missing values, filtering, and data type conversions.  Project 3 is data visualisation using Matplotlib and Seaborn, by creating various graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, line charts, and heatmaps, each highlighting a different aspect of the data.
